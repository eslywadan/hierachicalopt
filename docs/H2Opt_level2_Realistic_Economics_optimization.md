# H2Opt_level2_Realistic_Economics_optimization


## Why use economics optimization?
If not considering the **fixed costs**, the CP Solver will choose to produce nothing (allocation quantity = 0) due to min_cost objective. Rather than allocate something to produce, the cost of doing nothing is lower than production.

In real manufacturing, plants have significant **fixed costs** (depreciation, salaries, maintenance) that occur whether they produce or not. This creates a natural incentive to produce rather than sit idle. A **realistic economic model** that captures the true cost structure of manufacturing facilities. This addresses the fundamental issue of plants choosing to produce nothing.

## **Key Economic Realities Implemented:**

### **1. Fixed Costs (Occur Whether Producing or Not)**
```python
Weekly Fixed Costs per Plant:
- Asset Depreciation: $200,000-500,000 (equipment/facility)
- Fixed Salaries: $150,000-300,000 (management/technical staff)  
- Facility Costs: $50,000-200,000 (rent, insurance, utilities)
- Base Maintenance: $10,000-50,000 (preventive maintenance)
- Technology License: $30,000-100,000 (software, patents)

Total: $440,000-1,250,000 per week
```

### **2. Production Value (Revenue)**
```python
Panel Values (per unit):
- 15.6": $200 (laptop displays)
- 32": $650 (monitors)  
- 55": $1,200 (TVs)
- 65": $1,800 (large TVs)

Segment Multipliers:
- Gaming Monitor: 1.3x (premium)
- Professional: 1.5x (highest margin)
- Consumer TV: 1.0x (standard)
```

### **3. Economic Decision Logic**

The model now makes **real business decisions**:

**Scenario A: Idle Plant**
```
Revenue: $0
Fixed Costs: -$500,000
Variable Costs: $0
Net Result: -$500,000 LOSS
```

**Scenario B: Active Plant (50% utilization)**
```
Revenue: $3,000,000
Fixed Costs: -$500,000
Variable Costs: -$1,800,000
Net Result: +$700,000 PROFIT
```

This naturally incentivizes production!

## **How It Works:**

### **Plant Activation Decision**
```python
# Plant must decide: Operate or Shutdown?
if potential_revenue > fixed_costs + variable_costs:
    OPERATE (plant_active = 1)
    Must maintain minimum 30% utilization
else:
    SHUTDOWN (plant_active = 0)
    Avoid fixed costs, produce nothing
```

### **Product Selection**
```python
# Only produce if profitable
margin = product_value - variable_cost
if margin > required_contribution_to_fixed_costs:
    PRODUCE
else:
    REJECT (even with demand)
```

## **Example Output:**

```
📊 ECONOMIC SUMMARY:
  Revenue:           $24,500,000
  Variable Costs:   -$14,200,000
  Fixed Costs:      -$3,200,000  (only 4 of 6 plants active)
  Opportunity Cost: -$1,800,000
  ─────────────────────────────
  NET PROFIT:        $5,300,000

🏭 PLANT STATUS:
  Taiwan_Fab1:
    Status: ACTIVE ✓
    Utilization: 75%
    Fixed Costs: $800,000
    Revenue: $6,200,000
    Contribution: $5,400,000 ✓
    
  Korea_Fab1:
    Status: IDLE (Shutdown to avoid fixed costs)
    Reason: High costs, limited capabilities
```

## **Key Benefits:**

1. **Natural Production Incentive**: Empty plants lose money from fixed costs
2. **Realistic Shutdowns**: Unprofitable plants temporarily close
3. **Product Mix Optimization**: High-value products prioritized
4. **Break-even Analysis**: Each plant must cover its fixed costs
5. **Economic Viability**: Some products rejected despite demand if unprofitable

## **To Use in Your Code:**

```python
from h2opt_realistic_economics import level2_realistic_economics_optimization

# In your optimization:
allocations = level2_realistic_economics_optimization(
    capacity_allocation,
    agg_demand, 
    plant_df,
    planning_days=7
)

# Check the economic results
for alloc in allocations:
    if alloc['Allocations']:  # Now guaranteed to have allocations if profitable
        print(f"{alloc['Segment']}: {alloc['Fill_Rate']:.1f}% fill")
        print(f"Value Created: ${alloc['Value_Created']:,.0f}")
```

## **Why This Solves Your Problem:**

1. **Fixed costs create pressure to produce** - idle plants hemorrhage money
2. **Minimum utilization requirements** - if operating, must use at least 30% capacity  
3. **Value-based decisions** - production driven by profitability, not just feasibility
4. **Realistic plant behavior** - matches how real factories operate

This model ensures allocations are never empty unless it's genuinely more profitable to shut down the plant entirely, which is a valid business decision in real manufacturing!
